## About me

I love math and science, and I am currently a Frontend Dev with a tint in Data Science.
I love solving
problems and thinking for design, it's very rewarding to see hard work becomes artwork. I specialty is in JS, Python,
Node.JS, React, and MongoDB. I can manage frontend and backend to work seamlessly together.

When I am not coding,I spend time learning the Blockchain Technology and its future and I practice my Math for fun.
Outside the tech, I also enjoy volunteering, drawing and playing the piano. Also,I cook amazing Asian food.
