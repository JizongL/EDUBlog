Lemma 1: 2-connect $$\implies$$ connected





Lemma 2: 2-connect $$\implies$$ G \ e 2-connected

Theorem A: G 2-connected. $$\iff \forall v, w \in V, \exists$$ cycle containing v,w in G

Idea: 

($$\impliedby$$) easy

($$\implies$$) Induct on distance v to w. Base case is essentially Lemma 2. 

"Splice" cycles for inductive step. 

Is the Pertersen graph 2-connected?

Yes, and it is easy to prove. 

By vertex-transitive, we can delete a single vertex, and see that a connected graph is left.

Is this graph 2 connected?



Yes, but checking is not so easy. Using the definition or Thorem A, Next goal: Easy way to verify 2-connectivity. 


Definition: An ear decomposition of graph G is a sequence $$G_{0},G_{1},..,G_{n}$$
of subgraphs such that 
1) $$G_{0}$$ is a cycle. 
2) $$G_{n}=G$$
3) $$G_{i+1}$$ is obtained from $$G_{i}$$ (i = 0,1,2,...,n-1)
by adding vertices + edges of a path between 2 distinct vertices of $$G_{i}$$(called an ear)

Theorem B: 

The graph G is 2-connected $$\iff$$ G has an ear decomposition. 


Proof ($$\impliedby$$) Induct on number of ears. 

Base case: $$G \cong C_{k}$$, a cycle. 
Inductive step: n = numbers of ears. "n $$\implies n+1$$"

WTS: for any vertex v, $$G = G_{n+1}$$ is 2 connected. i.e. G\v is connected. 

If v is in $$G_{n}$$, then by induction $$G_{n}$$\v is connected. "Gluing" on path preserves connectivity, since at least 1 end point is ≠ v and we can walk to that end point in $$G_{n}$$ \ v. 


If v is a "new" vertex of the ear, then G\v leaves us with.

Which is clearly connected. 

$$\implies$$

WTS: If G is 2-connected, we can find ear decomposition:


Suppose that $$G_{n} \subset G$$ is a subgraph with ear decomposition $$G_{0},G_{1},...,G_{n}$$ and is maximal under this condition and show that $$G_{n}=G$$

(You could turn this prove into Algorithm to find ear-decomposition)


Suppose for contradiction that $$G_{n}≠ G$$

If $$G_{n}$$ has no vertices. then n = -1

Take v,w vertices of G, by theorem A there is a cycle containing them, Let this cycle be $$G_{0},$$ a bigger subgraph with ear decomposition. 




If $$\emptyset \not≤ V(G_{n}) \not≤ V(G)$$
Then $$\exists w \in V(G_{n})$$
and $$v \in V(G) \setminus V(G_{n})$$
By theorem A, $$\exists$$ cycle containing w,v.

Add the portion of the cycle between v and the first vertex on either side which is in $$G_{n}$$. as a new ear, (contradicts maximality of G_{n}). $$#$$

If $$V(G_{n})=V(G)$$ but $$E(G_{n}) \not≤E(G)$$
then any edge is a path of length 1, hence an ear attaching to $$G_{n}$$ and yielding $$G_{n+1}$$. The only remaining possibility is $$G_{n}=G$$ Q.E.D
