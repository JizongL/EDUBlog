* A
R1 ={(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2),(3,4),(4,1),(4,4)},
R2 ={(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)},
R3 ={(1,1),(1,2),(1,4),(2,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,1),(4,4)},
R4 ={(2,1),(3,1),(3,2),(4,1),(4,2),(4,3)},
R5 ={(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(3,3),(3,4),(4,4)}, 
R6 = {(3, 4)}.

* B

R1 ={(a,b)|a≤b},
R2 ={(a,b)|a>b},
R3 ={(a,b)|a=b or a=−b}, 
R4 ={(a,b)|a=b},
R5 ={(a,b)|a=b+1},
R6 ={(a,b)|a+b≤3}.


* reflexive
A relation R on a set A is called reflexive if (a,a) ∈ R for every element a ∈ A.

R3 and R5 (in A)
R3 and R4 (in B)

e.g (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4)

* symmetric and antisymmetric

A relation R on a set A is called symmetric if (b,a) ∈ R whenever(a,b) ∈ R,for all a,b ∈ A. A relation R on a set A such that for all a, b ∈ A, if (a, b) ∈ R and (b, a) ∈ R, then a = b is called antisymmetric.

* symmetric

R2 and R3 (in A)
R3, R4, and R6 (in B)

* antisymmetric

R4, R5, R6 (in A)
R1, R2, R4, and R5 in (B)

* transitive

A relation R on a set A is called transitive if whenever (a,b)∈R and (b,c)∈R, then (a,c) ∈ R, for all a,b,c ∈ A.
