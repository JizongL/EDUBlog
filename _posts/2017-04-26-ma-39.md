### Chromatic number

$$\chi (G)=$$ least k such that G has some k-coloirng. 
Lemma: G planar $$\implies$$ G has vertex with degree at most 5. 





**proof**

Suppose for contradiction that every v has deg v≥6.
Then $$\lvert E \lvert=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{v\in V} deg v ≥ \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot \lvert v \lvert = 3\lvert V \lvert$$

But by propositon proved previously 

$$\lvert E \lvert ≤ 3 \lvert V \lvert -6$$

### warm up theorem (6 color theorem)

G plannar $$\implies \chi(G) ≤ 6$$ 

Proof: Induct on $$\lvert V \lvert$$

**Base case:** $$\lvert V \lvert≤ 6$$

**Inductive step:** Using lemma, there is v with degree v ≤ 5. 
Color G\v with at most 6 colors by induction. 

Assign a color to v other than those of its ≤ 5 neighbors.
(possible, since have 6 colors) Q.E.D


### Theorem (5-color theorem)

G planar $$\implies \chi (G)≤5$$ 

proof: Induct on $$\lvert V \lvert$$

**Base case:** $$\lvert V \lvert ≤ 5$$

**Inductive step:** Using lemma, find v with degree v≤5, color $$G\setminus v$$ by induction.

If the neighbors of v use at most 4 colors, then color v with the "5th color" as in 6-color theorem. 

Remains to check when deg v = 5 and the neighbors all use different colors in the coloring of G \ v. 

Look for path x to y using only colors 1,3. 

**case 1:** $$\not\exists $$ such a path. 

**Theorem**

all 1 or 3-colored vertices is disconnected, with x and y in different components. 

Switch role of 1,3 in the component containing y, now y is colored 1, and we can color v with 3.

**case 2:** $$\exists$$ such a path. 

By adding v to path gives us a cycle, hence a Jordan Curve.

</figure>

Then any path z to w must cross the Jordan Curve, hence contain a vertex colored 1 or 3. 

$$\implies$$ no path from z to w using only colors 2,4 which puts us in case 1. (up to renumbering colors.)
