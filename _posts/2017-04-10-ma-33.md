Last time: $$A\subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$$ is connected if $$\forall x,y \in A \exists$$ arc in A from x to y, the connected regions of $$\mathbb{R}^{2} \setminus$$(image of plannar graph drawing), arc called faces.

Other surfaces: (obtained by gluing rectangles) 
Mobius stripe
cylinder
torus
klein bottle
projective plane $$\mathbb{R} P^{2}$$

Sphere 
$$S^{2} \\ =\{\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}: \vert{\vec{x}} =1\} \\ = $$obtained from a plane. by identifying entire boundary to point.

proposition: A graph G has an $$\mathbb{R}^{2}$$-drawing $$\iff $$ it has an $$S^{2}$$-drawing.

To prove this, we use the steorographic projection map. 

P: $$S^{2} \setminus$$ point $$\to \mathbb{R}^{2}$$
Let o wlog be the "north pole" (0,0,1) (otherwise, roatate the sphere to make it so)
and let $$\mathbb{R}$$ be the plane z = 1, which interests unit sphere at "south pole"(0,0,-1) and is in obvious correspondance with $$\mathbb{R}^{2}$$ (cts bijection with cts inverse)

For x≠0 on $$S^{2}$$

$$\exists$$ unique line passing through x and 0, Define p(x) to be the intersection of this line with z=-1. (The intersection exists, since x is "below" 0, as x is not"north pole")

fact: (means a theorem the lecturer is not going to prove. )

The stereographic projective map $$P: S^{2} \lvert \{o\} \to \mathbb{R}^{2}$$

is a continous bijection, and $$p^{-1}$$ is also continuous. 

without proof. 

plausibility: P has an inverse, so is a bijection. continuous since moving x a "little bit" result, in moving p(x) a "little bit". 

sketch

($$\implies$$) given an $$\mathbb{R}$$-drawing of G, compose it with $$P^{-1}$$. since composition of continuous maps is continuous. this is an $$S^{2}$$-drawing

($$\impliedby$$) let o be a point that is not on the $$S^{2}$$-drawing of G(Fact: such exists)

Now compose $$S^{2}$$-drawing with P and argue as above. 


Idea: Draw out graph on a transparent $$S^{2}$$ with a dark sharpie shine a light from the top of the $$S^{2}$$, look at the shadow of our drawing on the plane below. 

## 6.2 cycles + curves in planar graphs

We built our $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ drawings of G on arcs - (arcs are continuous and injectin $$[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^{2}$$)

Recall from Calc 1:

continous maps can be somewhat "wild". 

Eg: $$P: [0,1]\to \mathbb{R}^{2}, to \to (t,t \cdot Sin\frac{1}{t})$$ when t≠ 0 $$\to (0,0)$$ when t=0

Clearly, P is 1 to 1 /injective (from 1st coordinate), Thus, P is an arc !(the "topologist's" sin curve)
