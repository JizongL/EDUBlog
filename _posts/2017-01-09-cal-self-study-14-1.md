Limit

equations

Laplace's equation 

$$\frac{\partial{u}^{2}}{\partial{x}^{2}}+\frac{\partial{u}^{2}}{\partial{t}^{2}}=0$$

one of the solutions $$e^{2}$$ 

$$\frac{\partial{u}^{2}}{\partial{x}^{2}}+\frac{\partial{u}^{2}}{\partial{t}^{2}}+\frac{\partial{u}^{2}}{\partial{z}^{2}}=0$$

wave equation 

$$\frac{\partial{u}^{2}}{\partial{t}^{2}}=\alpha\frac{\partial{u}^{2}}{\partial{x}^{2}}$$

one of the solutions $$sin(x-at)$$



facts

$$tan^{-1}(x)$$ continuous everywhere.

$$sin^{-1}(x)$$ continuous at {-1,1}

remember to use implicit differentiation for z
$$ 3x^{2} + 3z^{2} \frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{x}} + 6yz + 6xy\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{x}} = 0$$

$$f(x,y)=\frac{xy}{sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}}$$ use squeeze theorem 

$$0 ≤ frac{xy}{sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}}≤ \lvert x \lvert since \lvert y \lvert ≤ sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$$  and $$\lvert x lvert \to 0$$ as $$(x,y) \to (0,0)$$


Q29 $$F(x,y)=\frac{xy}{1+e^{x-y}}$$

The function xy and $$1+e^{x-y}$$ are continuous everywhere, and $$1+e^{x-y}$$ is never zero, so $$F(x,y)=\frac{xy}{1+e^{x-y}}$$ is continuous on its domain $$\mathbb{R}^{2}$$


Q 30 $$F(x,y) = cos sqrt{1+x-y} = g(f(x,y)) where f(x,y) = sqrt{1_x-y}, continuous on its domain $$\{(x,y) \lvert 1+x-y≥0\}=\{(x,y) \lvert y ≤ x+1\}$$, and g(t) = cos t is continuous everywhere. Thus F is continuous on its domain $$\{ (x,y) \lvert y≤x+1\}$$

Q 33 $$G(x,y) = ln(x^{2}+y^{2}-4)=g(f(x,y)) \ where \ f(x,y)= x^{2}+y^{2} -4$$, continuous on $$\mathbb{R}^{2}$$ and g(t)= ln t, continious on domain $$\{t \lvert t>0\}$$. Thus G is continuous on its domain \{(x,y) \lvert x^{2}+y^{2}-4>0\} = \{(x,y) \lvert x^{2}+y^{2} > 4\}, the exterior of the circle x^{2}+y^{2} = 4$$
