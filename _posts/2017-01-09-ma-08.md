3 in both theater and ballet    $$A_{1} \land A_{2}$$
2 in both theater and choir		$$A_{1} \land A_{3}$$
5 in both ballet and choir 		$$A_{1} \land A_{3}$$

1 in all 3.  $$A_{1} \land A_{2} \land A_{3}$$

30 +10 + 20 -3 -2 -5 + 1 = 51

In general, call the sets 

$$A_{1},A_{2},...,A_{n}$$

and we desire to count 

$$\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}A_{i}$$


If $$A_{1},A_{2},...,A_{n}$$ 

are finite sets 

then 

$$ \left| \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_{i} \right| = \sum{\emptyset \subseteq \{1,2,...,3\} } (-1)^{\lvert I \lvert -1} \left| \bigcap_{k \in I} A_{k} \right|$$

Add all odd n's.
subract all even n's.


Proof

See textbook for proof 3

We will check that above formula counts each x in LHS, exactly once (in net), If $$x \in LHS$$, then x is in same number j of the sets. 

WLOG

let these set be $$A_{1}, A_{2},...A_{j}$$

(Otherwise, re-number the set indices)

How many intersection n's of k of these sets does x appear in? i,e 

how many ns of k of the $$A_{1},...,A{j}$$

how many k elements subsets of $$\{1,...j\}$$

$$\binom{j}{k}$$

$$j - \binom{j}{2}+\binom{j}{3} - ... +-\binom{j}{j}$$


How many k elements subset of $$\{\}$$

$$\binom{j}{k}$$

$$A_{i}$$

Using binomial thorem 

Above = $$1-(1-1)^{j}=1-0=1$$

Since x was arbitrary, and is counted exactly once in net, this finishes proof.
