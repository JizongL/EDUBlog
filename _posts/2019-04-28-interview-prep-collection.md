### Environment

Environments and CI are topics that will often get questioned in full-stack interviews so basic
knowledge of their purpose can go a long way!

Some "pre-production" environments you might come across are:

development (not local)
test
integration
stage
acceptance
nft (non-functional-testing)
other environments based on a company's conventions
