### Question 1

State the definition of the distance dG(v,w) between vertices v and w in a connected graph G.







Let $$G = (V,E)$$ be a connected graph. We define the distance of two vertices $$v, v′ ∈ V (G)$$, denoted by $$d_{G}(v, v′)$$, as the length of a shortest path from v to v′ in G.

### Question 2
Give an example of a graph which satisfies Euler’s formula $$(|V | − |E| = 1)$$, but which is not a tree.

### Question 3
Find the adjacency matrix for $$K_{1,3}$$. Indicate clearly the vertex ordering that you are using.


### Question 4
Draw an example of a Sperner coloring of a subdivision having at least 10 small triangles (of a big triangle). Indicate on your drawing all of the small triangles which receive all 3 colors.

### Question 5

Characterize the values of n and m such that $$K_{n,m}$$ is Eulerian (i.e., such that $$K_{n,m}$$ has a closed Eulerian tour).


### Question 6

(2 points) Prove that if G is a tree, then G is cycle-free and satisfies the Euler formula. (You may use the Tree Characterization Theorem.)


(8 points) Prove that if G is cycle-free and satisfies the Euler formula, then G is a tree.

### Question 7

3. (10 points) Let v be a vertex of degree 1 in G. Prove that G is connected if and only if G \ v is connected.
