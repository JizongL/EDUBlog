Last time review






Finished proof of tree characterization theorem)
Isn't induction usfeful. 

### Definition. 
A spanning tree for graph G(V,E) is a subgraph G' of G which is a tree, and contains all vertices of G. 


Note: Equivalently (by tree characteristics)

a spanning tree is a connected subgraph of G, with $$\lvert  V\lvert$$ vertices. And  $$\lvert  V\lvert$$ - 1 edges. 

Exi: Any tree on $$\{1,2,...,n\}$$ is a spanning tree for $$K_{n}$$

Clearly, any graph with a spanning tree is connected.

conversely. 

### Theorem: 
If G is connected, then G has a spanning tree. 

So a spanning tree is a "certificate" of connectedness.

We will prove the theorem by giving an algorithm and proving it returns a spanning tree when G is connected. 

### Algorithm 1: 


(Cycle-avoiding subgraph)


input: G = (V,E), where $$E = \{e_{1},e_{2}...,e_{m}\}$$ has an order. 

Set $$E_{0} = \emptyset$$

for i = 1 to m
	
if $$(v,E_{i-1} \cup \{e_{i}\})$$ has nocycle 
$$E_{i}=E_{i-1} \cup \{e_{i}\}$$

else:
$$E_{i} = E_{i-1}$$

do

return $$T=(V,E_{m})$$

return $$T = (V,E_{m})$$

### **Proposition:** 
If G has $$\lvert V \lvert - K$$ connected components; Then output T of Algorithm 1 has exactly k edges, In particular, if G is connected, then T is a spanning tree. 

**Proof**
By consturction, T is cycle-free. So each connected components of T is a tree. Each component has 1 fewer edges than vertices. 

$$\implies$$ edges of T is $$\lvert V\lvert$$ - number of connected components of T. 

To finish the proof, we show. 

Claim: x,y in same connected compnent of T. $$\iff$$ x,y in same connected compnent of G. 

**proof of claim:**

$$\implies$$ Clearly, since a walk in T is also a walk in G. 


$$\impliedby$$ Suppose for contradiction that x,y are in same component of G but different component of T. Then $$\exists$$ walk $$x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{l}$$ from x to y in G. 

Let $$x_{i}$$ be the last vertex of the walk that is in the same component of T as x. (so $$x_{i+1}$$ is in a different component,) Now $$e =\{x_{i},x_{i+1}\} \in E(G)$$ but not in $$E(T)$$. So T+e has a cycle containing $$x_{i},x_{i+1}$$ (by algorithm). $$\implies \exists$$ path $$x_{i}$$ to $$x_{i+1}$$ in T contradicting that $$x_{i},x_{i+1}$$ are in different conponents. #. Q.E.D.


### Definition

A forest is a graph where every connected component is a tree. 

Equivalently, a forest is a cycle free graph. 

Note: Algorthm 1, run on an abitrary graph G returns a spanning forest for G. (ie, a spanning tree on each connected component)
