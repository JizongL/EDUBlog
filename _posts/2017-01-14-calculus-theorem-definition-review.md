**Definition** 

Let f be a function of two variables whose domain D includes points arbitrarily close to  a, b . Then we say that the limit of f  x, y  as  x, y  approaches  a, b  is L and we write

$$\lim{(x,y) \to (a,b)} f (x, y)=L$$ 

if for every number $$ \epsilon > 0$$ there is a corresponding number $$ \delta > 0$$ such that

if  $$(x,y) \in D$$ and $$0 < \sqrt{(x-a)^{2}+ (y- b)^{2}} < \delta  $$ then $$ \vert f(x,y)-L \vert < \epsilon $$   


**note**
If $$f(x,y) \to L_{1}$$ as $$ (x,y) \to (a,b)$$ along a path $$C_{1}$$ and $$f(x,y) \to L_{2}$$ as
 $$(x,y) \to (a, b)$$  along a path $$C_{2}$$, where $$L_{1} \neq L_{2}$$, then $$\lim{(x, y) \to (a, b)} f( x,y)$$  does not exist.
