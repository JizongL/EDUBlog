Continued proof from last lecture

(iii) $$iff$$ (i) again: 






Suppose for contradiction that G has cycle, and let e be an edge of the cycle. 

Then any walk v to w in G (guaranteed by connectedness of G)

Then the walk either doesn't pass over e, (and is still a walk in G\e) or it passes over e. 

maybe be "spliced" by removing the step over e, and replace it with a walk around the other side of the cycle. 


Since this process gives walk from an arbitrary v to an arbitrary w in G\e. 

And we know that G\e is connected, so it is a contradiction.

(i)$$\iff$$(iv): cycle free is given

If $$\{x,y\} \not\in E$$

Then G connected $$\iff \exists$$ path x to y. 
Adding $$\{x,y\}$$ to edges set of G, allows us to extend the path to a cycle. 

$$\impliedby$$: cycle free is given. 
Need to show $$\forall x,y \in V, \exists path x$$ to y in G. 
If $$\{x,y\} \in E$$ then done. Otherwise, $$G+\{x,y\}$$ has a cycle containing x,y, and removing $$\{x,y\}$$ yields a path. 

(i) $$\iff$$ (v): connectedness is given.

Induction $$\{\lvert V \lvert$$ (with tree pruning principle)
Base case: $$\lvert V \lvert=1$$

Inductive step: Removing a leaf leaves a tree (using Lemmas 1,2) with 1 fewer vertex + 1 fewer edge. 

And $$(\lvert V \lvert-1)-(\lvert E \lvert-1)=1$$

then $$\lvert V \lvert -\lvert E \lvert =1$$

$$(v) \implies (i)$$ connectedness is given.

We show cycle-free-ness by induction on $$\lvert V \lvert$$ again. 

Base case

$$\lvert V \lvert=1$$

Inductive step

$$\lvert V \lvert-1 \implies \lvert E \lvert$$

By the Handshaking Lemma. 

$$\sum_{v \in V} deg(v) = 2 \lvert E \lvert = 2 \cdot (\lvert V \lvert -1) < 2\cdot \lvert V \lvert$$

since degree v is nonnegative integer and is ≥ 1 as G is connected(for any vertex v). 

We must have a vertex of degree 1. Let's name this vertex v. 

But now G\v has 1 fewer vertex + 1 fewer edge than G. 

So also satisfies $$\lvert V \lvert -\lvert E\lvert =1$$ relation. 

And since paths may only have degree 1 vertices at the end. G\v is connected and is a tree. 

Thus by induction, so by tree prunning (lemma),G is as well a tree. Q.E.D

## Chapter 5.3 Spanning tree

Definition: A spanning tree for a graph G=(V,E) is a subgraph G' of G. which is a tree, and contains all the vertices of G. (i,e G'=(V,E')) is a tree where (E'≤ E). 

Ex: $$C_{n}$$ has n spanning trees, each obtained by deleting a single edge from $$C_{n}$$
