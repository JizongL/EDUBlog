Matoušek-Nešetřil p204: 3

3. Prove that a planar graph in which each vertex has degree at least 5 must have at least 12 vertices.



Matoušek-Nešetřil p214: 1

1. Prove that χ(G) ≤ 1 + max{deg_{G}(x): x ∈ V } holds for every (finite) graph G = (V, E).



A. If α and β are arcs with α(1) = β(0), then explain in detail how to "glue" α and β to get an arc γ so that γ(0) = α(0) and γ(1) = β(1).
