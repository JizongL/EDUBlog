![topologist's sin curve](https://dyinglovegrape.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/image.png)

How can we grantee "nice" behavior in the presence of arcs like this?
Approach 1: Only allow straight lines, (restrictive, and only helps so much!)


![Jordan curve](https://groupoids.org.uk/images/jordancurve.jpg)

Approach 2 (what we'll do)
use a theorem

Define: A Jordan curve
$$f:[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^{2}$$

which is inective except that f(0) = f(1)

(Alternate definition: Jordan curve is  continuous injection $$S^{1} \to \mathbb{R}^{2}$$). $$S^{1}$$ is a circle

Fact: Jordan curve theorem (J(T))

If J is the image of a Jordan curve in $$\mathbb{R}$$

then $$\mathbb{R}^{2} \setminus J$$ consists of exactly 2 connected regions. 

an interior region and an exterior region

![interior and exterior regions](http://mathfaculty.fullerton.edu/mathews/c2003/cauchygoursat/CauchyGoursatMod/Images/mat0615.gif)

Definition: For a region A to be bounded, means that $$\exists$$ number M such that, $$\forall x \in A$$, $$d(x,orgin)≤ M$$

For uncomplicated curves like circle or polygon, J(T is obvious,In general, not so much! Proof is relatively hard, omitted)

Notice: An $$\mathbb{R}^{2}$$ drawing of $$C_{n}$$ induces a Jordan curve.

$$r:[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^{2}
\begin{cases}
\alpha_{1,2}(nt),  & \text{for 0 ≤ t ≤ $\frac{1}{n}$} \\[2ex]
\alpha_{2,3}(nt-1),  & \text{for $\frac{1}{n}$ ≤ t ≤ $\frac{2}{n}$} \\[2ex]
\alpha_{3,4}(nt-2),  & \text{for $\frac{1}{n}$ ≤ t ≤ $\frac{2}{n}$} \\[2ex]
\vdots \\ [2ex]
\alpha_{n,1}(nt-(n-1)),  & \text{for $\frac{n-1}{n}$ ≤ t ≤ 1} \\[2ex]
\end{cases}
$$

$$\gamma(0) = \gamma(1)=v,$$

$$\gamma$$ is injective elsewhere by definition of $$\mathbb{R}^{2}$$-drawing

$$\gamma$$ is conituous since obtained by "gluing" continous arcs 

So $$\gamma$$ is JC. 


Corallary: If G is a graph, then any cycle in G yields a Jordan curve. 

We are ready to prove 

Theorem $$K_{5}$$ is not plannar

Proof: Suppose for contradiction $$K_{5}$$ has $$\mathbb{R}^{2}$$-drawing with points $$v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{5}$$ in $$\mathbb{R}^{2}$$
 

Then $$v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}$$ gives 3-cycle gives JC.

Now $$v_{4}$$ is an inside or outside of this JC. (in/out exist by J(T)).

WLOG $$v_{4}$$ is on inside(by sterographic lifting/ projecting or use similar argumment).
