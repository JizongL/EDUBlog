Construct Petersen graph with a set and some rules. 

![complete Graph 5]({{root_url | prepend: site.baseurl}}/asset/graph_theory/pic/First-Course-GT/1-a.png)
Let $$\mathbf{S} = \{-6,-3,0,3,6\}$$. Draw the graph G whose vertex set is \mathbf{S} and such that $$ij \in E(G) for i , \in \mathbf{S} if i+j \in \mathbf{S} or \lvert i-j\lvert \in \mathbf{S}$$

Spanning subgraph
If a subgraph of a graph G has the same vetex set as G, then it is a spanning subgraph of G.
