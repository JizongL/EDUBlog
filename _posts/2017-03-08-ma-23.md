2) is very useful for proving thems. 

3) is most useful for recognizing

1) is m between 

## Ch 5.1: Trees

A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. 

Why is called a "tree"?

###Example: $$P_{n}$$ is a tree.

### example 2: $$k_{1,n}$$




### Bigger examples





Similarly to 2-connected, 
It'll be convenient to have serveral equivalent conditions for being a tree

(Several characterizations of trees)


### Theorem: Tree Characterization

(will prove on next lecture)

For a graph G=(V,E), TFAE(The following are equivalent). 

i)G is a tree. 

ii) $$\forall v,w \in V$$, there is **exactly one path** from v to w. **path uniqueness** (because it is connected, so there is a path between any two vertices)

iii)G is connected, and $$\forall e \in E$$, G \ e is not connected. **(minimally connected)**

iv)G has no cycles, and $$\forall e \in \binom{v}{2} \ E$$. $$G+e$$ has a cycle. 
**(maximally acyclic)**


v) G is connected and has w/ $$\lvert V\lvert-\lvert E\lvert = 1$$(Euler's formula for trees)



###Check for $$K_{1,4}$$

Use tree characterization to varify if it is a tree.

ii)	checked 

iii)	G \e is disconnected.  check

iv)  G+e $$\cong$$   has a $$C_{3}$$ check

v) 	5-4 = 1   check


Notice: all trees we've seen have a vetex of degree 1. 

Definition: A vertex of degree 1 in a graph G, is called an end vertex or a leaf (especially, if G is a tree)

### Lemma: Trees have leaves

If graph G is a tree, with $$\lvert V\lvert>1$$ then G has at least 2 leaves. 

### Example

$$P_{n}$$ has exactly 2 leaves. 

$$K_{1,n}$$ has n leaves

### Proof the of Lemma

Let P = $$v_{0},v_{1},...,v_{n}$$ be a path of maximum length in G. 

Suppose for contradiction:  $$deg v_{0}> 1$$, then $$v_{0}$$ has $$v_{1}$$ as neighbor and also some vertex w, since G has no cycles, $$w\not\in \{v_{2},v_{2},...,v_{n}\}$$. so $$\{w,v_{2},v_{2},...,v_{n}$$ is a path longer than P(as vertices are distinct). 
Condtradictions to maximallity of p. #

similar for $$v_{n}$$
Thus deg $$v_{0}= deg v_{n}=1$$, as desired. Q.E.D

The following is great for induction Lemma: (tree prunning)

Let G=(V,E) be a graph and v be a leaf vertexm then G is a tree$$\iff$$ G \ v is a tree.
