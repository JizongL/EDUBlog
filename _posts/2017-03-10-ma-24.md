Tree Characterization

Tree is a connected and cycle-free graph.






1: G is a tree.

2: $$\forall x,y \exists$$ unique path from x to y

3: G is connected, but $$\forall e \in E $$, G \ e not connected. 

4: G is cycle free, but $$\forall e \in E$$,G+e has cycle.

5: G is connected and $$\lvert V \lvert -\lvert E \lvert = 1$$

Leaf or end vertex has degree 1

Lemma 1: Any tree has (at least 2) leaves.

Lemma 2: (Tree prunning) G is tree $$\iff$$ G \ leaf is tree. 


### proof of Lemma 2

Let v be vetex of degree 1 

$$\implies$$ since G is cycle-free so is G\v. 

If x,y are vertices in G \ v, then there is a path from x to y in G. 

**Since** 

the only vertices of a path graph with degree 1 are the end points, so v can not be any of the interial vertex of the path x to y in G. So the path in G is also a path in G\v. 

$$\impliedby$$ since degree v = 1, v is in no cycle. (because any vertex in a cycle has degree 2). and G\v is cycle-free $$\implies$$ G is cycle-free. 

Also, G\v is connected $$\exists$$ path x to y when neither is v. Remains to find a path from any vertex x to v. Let w be the unique neighbor of v. 

To get path from x to v, take the path from x to w given by connectedness of G\v. And add v to the end. This gives a path from x to v. Q.E.D

### Proof of Theorem: 

Strategy: Show (using the 5 tree characterization to prove)

i $$\implies$$ ii $$\implies$$ iii $$\implies$$ i

i $$\iff$$ iv

i $$\iff$$ v

(goes through all 7 parts of the proof)

First:

i $$\implies$$ ii:

Since G is connected, $$\forall x,y \exists$$ path x to y. 

Now, show that the path is unique. 

If remains to show the path is unique, we use induction on $$\lvert V\lvert$$ and tree prunning

Base case: $$\lvert V\lvert$$ = 0,$$\lvert V\lvert$$ =1. 

Inductive step: "$$\lvert V\lvert - 1$$ $$\implies$$ $$\lvert V\lvert$$"

**note:** 🐰 means a vertex, as our instructor insists it is a rabbit day today. 😅

If x is a tree graph "🐰" is a leaf vertex, then by induction there is a unique path from x to y in G \ 🐰 (for any x,y distinct from 🐰. 

Since 🐰 may only appear as end vertex of a path, adding 🐰 does not affect uniqueness. We still need to find a path from arbitrary vetex x to 🐰.  

Since 🐰 is a leaf, it has unique neighbor 🐰' and as there is a unique path from x to 🐰' and as $$\{🐰' ,🐰\}$$ must be the last step of any path to 🐰, then we have our uniqueness. Q.E.D


(ii) $$\implies$$ (iii):

Unique path is a path, so G is connected. (checked)

Also, if $$e=\{v,w\}$$ is an edge, then v,w is a path from v to w. (path of length 1). So is unique. 

So if we delete e, there is no path from v to w. then the graph is disconnected. 

(iii) $$\implies$$ (i):

G is connected (given), Also a cycle yields 2 distinct paths between any 2 vertices on the cycle. 


Then remove any edge on the cycle will fail to connect. (details after break)
