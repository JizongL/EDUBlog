## The mathematical theory of pairwise relation

Defnintion: a _graph_ G is an ordered pair (V,E)

Where V is some set (called vertices)





and E is sa set of 2-element subsets of V, [called edges]

For us, **V** will almost always be finite

V = (1,2,3,4)
((1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,2))

note: (1,1) is illegal

[See diagram 1](/asset/graph_theory/pic/001.jpg)


we often represent graphs with a picture.

idea: 2 elements(ells) of V are "related", or not

## Ex1: Map Graph

V = countries (or states or counties or ...) on a map

E = pairs which share a boarder. 

[See diagram 2](asset/graph_theory/pic/002.jpg)

states

Q1: How to set to FL passing through fewest # of states.

Q2: How to efficiently color the states so that adjacant states get different colors

## Ex2: www-graph

V = web pages

E = pairs (A,B) (so that A links to B)

[See diagram 3](/asset/graph_theory/pic/003.jpg)

Q1. How do you efficiently "Crawl" the www-graph?

Ex  K_n = graph with n vertices, with all possible edges.
