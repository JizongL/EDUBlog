## 6.1
### Cardinality

Definition: Let X,Y be sets, we say X and Y have the same cardinality if $$\exists$$ bijection $$f:X \to Y$$

two sets have same cardinality
$$\lvert X \lvert =\lvert Y \lvert$$ and we say $$X,Y$$ are Equinumerous. 

Equinumerousity is an equivalence relation. 

proof
(a)reflexive
$$\lvert X \lvert = \lvert X \lvert$$

(2)symmetric
let $$\lvert X \lvert = \lvert Y \lvert \implies  \exists f:X \to Y$$ so $$f^{-1}:Y \to X$$ as bijection so $$\lvert Y \lvert = \lvert X \lvert$$

(3)transitive
let $$\lvert X \lvert = \lvert Y \lvert$$,$$\lvert Y \lvert = \lvert Z \lvert$$ 
Then $$\exists$$ bijection $$f:X \to Y,g:y \to Z$$
$$g \circ f: X \to Z$$ but $$f \circ f$$ is composit function and therefore it is also bijection,so $$g \circ f$$ is bijection. 



### Definition
Let X be a set X is a finite set
