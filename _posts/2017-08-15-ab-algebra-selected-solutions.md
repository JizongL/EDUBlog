The following solutions are better than those on Chegg

Let $$p, q,$$ and $$r$$ be primes other than $$3$$. Show that $$3$$ divides $$p^2 + q^2 + r^2$$
Let $$p, q, r$$ be primes other than 3. Show that 3 divides $$p^2 + q^2 + r^2$$.

Solution: 

Itâ€™s equivalent to show that $$p^2 +  q^2 + r2 \equiv  0 mod 3$$. Since $$p,q,r$$ are primes, 3 does not divide any of them. Therefore, each of these is either equal to 1 or 2 mod 3. Squaring these,we get either $$1^2  =1 mod 3$$ or $$2^2 = 4 =  1 mod3$$. Thus, for any choice of $$p,q,r$$,
$$p^2 + q^2 + r^2 mod 3 \equiv 1 + 1 + 1 (mod3) \equiv  3 mod 3 \equiv 0 mod 3$$.
