### The concept of Graph Scores

The degree of a vertex v in G is the number of edges containing v. 






The degree seuqence of graph G, defined as $$deg_{G}v_{1}$$ is the sequence of degrees of vertx in G.Sorted in non-decreasing order. 

For example

</figure>


### Observation: 

Isomorphic graphs have same degree sequences. Take the contrapositive, graphs with different degree sequence, are non isomorphic. However,the converse of observation is not true. Graphs has the same degree sequence are not necessarily isomorphic.

For example: (2,2,2,2,2,2) see figures below.

### Handshaking Theorem

A main fact about degrees of graph

*Proposition*

For any graph G=(V,E), we have $$\sum_{v \in V}deg_{G}v = 2 \lvert  E \lvert$$

**Proof.** 

Count the numbers of "vertex-edge incidences", that is the pairs (v,e) so that $$v\in e$$ in 2 different ways. 

First way: 

Each edge contains 2 vertice. We get $$2 \lvert E \lvert$$ incidences. 


Second way:

Each vertex v is contained in $$deg_{G} v$$ edges
$$\sum deg_{G}v   $$ incidences. 

We see that both ways have the same result, the total of a degree sequences is $$2\lvert E\lvert$$
Q.E.D

### Corallary: 

If G is finite graph, then the number of vertices of odd degree is an even number.

</figure>

Note: If you allow infinite graphs, the statement of Cor, no longer holds. 

1-sided infinite path

only vertex 1 has odd degree, the rest of the vertices have even. 

2-sided infinite path 

has 0 vertices of odd degree. 

Moral of the lesson: $$\infty$$'s complicate counting + parity(even/odd)

## Sperner's Lemma (Chapter 7.1)

Strt with large  with corners. $$V_{R},V_{G},V_{B}$$ colored R,G,B,respectively. 

<figure>
<img src = "{{root_url | prepend: site.baseurl}}/asset/graph_theory/pic/class-note/class-16/16-1-h.png" width = "300">

</figure>


Then sub divide it into smaller triangles. 




color the corners of small triangles R,G,B where "corners" are outside edges receive color of one of the end points of that outside edge.

</figure>

Such a coloring is called Sperner coloring of the subdivision. 

Theorem: For any Sperner coloring of subdivided triangle there is always a "rainbow" small triangle, whose corners use all 3 colors. 

Will prove it next class.
