Recall: Give a political map the map graph has a vertex for each country and edges between countries sharing a border. 







Assume each country is arc-connected. 

Q: Can every "nice" map be colored with 4 colors such that adjacent countries are different colors. 

History
~ 1852  
4-color question asked by Guthrie

~ 1976  
Appel + Haken
Reduce to > 1000 cases.
check by computer
~ 150 pages + computer code

~ 90's ~ 00's: 
Robertson, Sanders, Seymonr+ Thomas
improve the proof. 
~ 40 pages		

But: Its easy to show 6 colors suffice not difficult " " 5 " ".
Note: Some maps need 4 colors!

Fact: The map graph is planar (if countries are arc-conn)

Defn: A (k-)coloring of graph G = (V,E)for $$k \in \mathbb{N}$$ 

is a $$f(n) c:V \to \{1,2,...,k\}$$

such that $$c(x)≠ c(y) if \{x,y\}\in E$$

The chromatic number of G is the smallest number K such G has k-coloring write as $$\chi(G)$$

Ex: $$\chi(K_{n})=n$$ since $$\{x,y\}\in E$$ for every x,y

Ex: $$\chi(C_{3})=3=\chi(C_{5})$$

Ex: $$\chi(C_{4})=2=\chi(C_{6})$$

Ex: $$\chi(K_{n,m})=2$$

Indeed, G bipartite $$\iff$$ $$\chi(G)≤2$$

Observe: If G has a 2 coloring then it also has a 3-coloring, 4-coloring, .....
