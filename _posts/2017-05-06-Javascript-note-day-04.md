### Wrapper Objects

The temporary objects created when you access a property of a string, number, or boolean are known as wrapper objects

strings have properties and methods:

```
var s = "hello world!";                             // A string
var word = s.substring(s.indexOf(" ")+1, s.length); // Use string properties

```


```
var s = "test";         // Start with a string value.
s.len = 4;              // Set a property on it.
var t = s.len;          // Now query the property.
```

### Immutable Primitive Values and Mutable Object References


```
var s = "hello";   // Start with some lowercase text
s.toUpperCase();   // Returns "HELLO", but doesn't alter s
s                  // => "hello": the original string has not changed

```


object values are references, and we say that objects are compared by reference: two object values are the same if and only if they refer to the same underlying object.

### Objects are different than primitives

```
var o = { x:1 };     // Start with an object
o.x = 2;             // Mutate it by changing the value of a property
o.y = 3;             // Mutate it again by adding a new property

var a = [1,2,3]      // Arrays are also mutable
a[0] = 0;            // Change the value of an array element
a[3] = 4;            // Add a new array element
```

Objects are not compared by value
```
var o = {x:1}, p = {x:1};  // Two objects with the same properties
o === p                    // => false: distinct objects are never equal
var a = [], b = [];        // Two distinct, empty arrays
a === b                    // => false: distinct arrays are never equal
```

Objects are sometimes called reference types to distinguish them from JavaScriptâ€™s primitive types


assigning an object (or array) to a variable simply assigns the reference: it does not create a new copy of the object
```
var a = [];   // The variable a refers to an empty array.
var b = a;    // Now b refers to the same array.
b[0] = 1;     // Mutate the array referred to by variable b.
a[0]          // => 1: the change is also visible through variable a.
a === b       // => true: a and b refer to the same object, so they are equal.

```

### Using for loop to make deep copy
```
var a = ['a','b','c'];              // An array we want to copy
var b = [];                         // A distinct array we'll copy into
for(var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) { // For each index of a[]
    b[i] = a[i];                    // Copy an element of a into b
}
```

### compare two distinct objects or arrays

Similarly, if we want to compare two distinct objects or arrays, we must compare their properties or elements. This code defines a function to compare two arrays:

```
function equalArrays(a,b) {
    if (a.length != b.length) return false; // Different-size arrays not equal
    for(var i = 0; i < a.length; i++)       // Loop through all elements
        if (a[i] !== b[i]) return false;    // If any differ, arrays not equal
    return true;                            // Otherwise they are equal
}
```
