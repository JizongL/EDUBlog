Definition: A graph G = (V,E) is bipartite if $$V = U \cup W$$ disjoint

and $$E \subset \{\{u,w\}: u \in U, w \in W\}$$





Thus $$K_{n,m}$$ is bipartite graph with parts of size n,m and as many edges as possible. 

### Ex-1 $$P_{4}$$ is bipartite

Anti-example $$K_{3}$$ is not bipartite

Since no way of splitting vertices without edge in one of the parts. 



Notice: $$C_{4}$$ looks a lot like $$k_{2,2}$$

are they the same?

When are two graphs the same?

one answer: 

Definition: $$A_{n}$$ isomorphism of graphs

$$G=(V,E) \ and \ G'=(V',E')$$

is a bijection $$f: V \to V'$$

such that it preserves the edges

$${x,y} \in E \ \Longleftrightarrow \{f(x),f(y)\}\in E'$$

That is, f is a 1 to 1 correspondence between vertice, which "preserves edges"

If $$\exists$$ an isomorphism $$G \to G'$$

then we say they are isomorphic $$G\cong G'$$

### Ex-2. $$L_{3} \cong K_{3}$$

both have all possible edges on $$\{1,2,3\}$$

### Ex-3 
$$C_{4} \cong K_{2,2}$$



e.g map

### anti-example

$$C_{s} \lnot \cong K_{2,3}$$

see antiexample picture above

We may ask why not?

Because different number of edges, so can't possiblely have edge perserving bijection

See picture above

Since RHS graph has every vertex in exactly 2 edges. and LHS does not. Therefore, they are not isomorphic to each other. 

**Caution:** 

The definition of isomorphism is important and easy to "mess up"


### Definition automorphism : 

$$A_{n}$$ automorphism of a graph G is an isomorphism $$G \to G$$

(from G to itself)

Notice: Always have $$G \cong G$$

since they are indentitically mapped to each other

$$(x \to x, \forall x)$$



### Ex-4: 

![pic8]({{root_url | prepend: site.baseurl}}/asset/graph_theory/pic/class-note/class-11-f.jpeg)

The two graphs above are in isomorphism, and automorphism. Then we observe that Automorphism describes the concept of symmetry. 

### Ex-5: Automorphism of $$C_{5}$$

id. 

5 of them $$\to$$ flip over an axis(e.g exchange 2,5 and 3,4)

Rotations:
$$i \to i+ 1 \ i < 5 , \ 5 \to 1$$
