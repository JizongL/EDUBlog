Theorem: G is 2-connected with $$\mathbb{R^{2}}$$ drawing $$\implies$$ every face is interior or exterior of some cycle. 






1-skeleton of polyhedron $$\iff$$ 3-connected planargraph:

Theorem: (Euler's formula planar)

PF of Euler's 

Induction on $$\lvert E \lvert$$
Base case last time. 

Inductive step: Assume true for all graphs with smaller number of edges:

Case 1: G is a tree
Immediate by Lemma + Euler's for trees;
$$\lvert V \lvert - \lvert E \lvert + f = 1 + 1 = 2$$

Case 2: G is not tree
G connected $$\implies$$ G has a cycle C. Let e be an edge in C. 

By Jordan Curve Theorem, C is adjacent to (at least) 2 faces and 2 faces are identified by removing e.

</figure>

Also, G\e remains connected (since if we pass over e in a walk, then walk over(\e instead))

So the inductive hypothesis applies, and 

$$ \lvert V(G\setminus e) -\lvert E(G\setminus e)\lvert + f(G \setminus e) = 2$$

$$\lvert V \lvert - (\lvert E \lvert -1)+ (f-1)$$

$$\lvert V \lvert - \lvert E \lvert + f = 2$$

as desired. Q.E.D

Collary 1: number of faces of $$\mathbb{R^{2}}$$-drawing of G depends only on G. 



Application 2: How many edges (an planar graph have?)

Proposition: If G is a planar graph with at least 3 vertices, then

$$\lvert E \lvert ≤ 3 \lvert V \lvert - 6$$

compare with $$K_{n}$$, which has $$\frac{1}{2}(\lvert V^{2}\lvert - \lvert V \lvert )$$

Equality is achieved $$\iff$$ G is maximal planar(note: G is planar but G + e is not planar for any edge$$

pf: suffices to prove for G maximal planar(otherwise add edges!)

consider a vertex v, then v has degree ≥ 2
(otherwise, could add an edge from v to the boundary of the face containing v.)

Now look at edges incident to $$v_{i}$$


claim: There is an edge $$\{x_{i},x_{i+1}\}$$ (mod n) for all i. 

Otherwise, "pull arcs slightly off" to add arc $$x_{i}$$ to $$x_{i+1}$$ without crossings. 

So every face at v is a triangle, so " " is a triangle. 

Also, Jordan Curve Theorem $$\implies$$ every edge is adjcant to 2 faces. $$\implies$$ $$3f=2\lvert E \lvert$$
So, by Euler 

$$\lvert V \lvert - \lvert E \lvert + f = 2 \\
\lvert V \lvert - \lvert E \lvert + \frac{2}{3} \lvert E \lvert - \frac{1}{3}\lvert E \lvert
$$

Solve

$$\lvert E \lvert = 3\lvert V \lvert -6$$ as desired Q.E.D
