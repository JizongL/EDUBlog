Last time:
G connected graph with weight. function, $$w:E \to \mathbf{R}$$

problem: Find minimum weight spanning tree.

Lemma (Matroid Lemma for graphs)

Given cycle-free edge sets $$E_{f},E_{g}$$ with $$\lvert E_{f}\lvert< \lvert E_{g}\lvert \exists g \in E $$ such that $$E_{f}\cup\{g\}$$ is cycle free. Analogous to a lemma from linear algebra.

## Picture of Matroid Lemma proof. 

Crux was that some component of $$E_{g}$$ intersects 2 components of $$E_{f}$$

Recall: Algorithm 1
takes $$E = \{e_{1},e_{2},...,e_{m}\}$$ in some order. And at step i, adds $$e_{i}$$ to the edge sets of spanning forest unless doing so would create a cycle. 

Theorem: ("Greedy Algorithm works")
If G = (V,E) is connected graph with weight function $$w: E \to \mathbf{R}$$
and we take an edge order $$e_{1},e_{2},...,e_{m}$$ such that $$w(e_{1})≤w(e_{2}),...,≤ w(e_{m})$$ ("non-decreasing" or "weakly increasing")

Then Algorithm 1 (with this ordering) 

yields a minimum weight spanning tree for G. 

Remark: Why "Greedy"?
At each step of Algorithm 1, we look for the "cheapest" edge that we can add with no long term planning. 

(There are also many situations where Greedy approach does not work.e.g Hamiltonian cycle)

Proof: 
By previous theorem, algorithm 1 returns a spanning T, as G is connected. 

Suppose T is not minimum weight, then another spanning tree T' has smaller weight. 

Now T has edges $$e_{i_{1}},e_{i_{2}},...,e_{i_{n-1}}$$ order them in non-decreasing weight.

T' has edges $$e_{j_{1}},e_{j_{2}},...,e_{j_{n-1}}$$ order them in non-decreasing weight.

Suppose 
$$w(e_{i_{1}}) < w(e_{j_{1}})$$
$$w(e_{i_{2}}) < w(e_{j_{2}})$$
.
.
.
$$w(e_{i_{k-1}}) < w(e_{j_{k-1}})$$
$$w(e_{i_{k}}) < w(e_{j_{k}})$$

must happen, since weight of T' is < T.

Then the Matroid Lemma tells us that $$\exists e \in \{e_{j_{1}},e_{j_{2}},...,e_{j_{k-1}}\} \cup \{e\}$$ i cycle free. 
But we constructed T by adding edges in non-decreasing order of weight, we would have added e beore adding $$e_{i_{k}}$$, which contradicts consturction of T. #

Remarks

1: Minimal weight spanning trees have obvious practical applications. 

2: This is a start to the field of combinatorial optimization. 
And the related field. 

3: Matroid theory.

Q what graphs can we draw without edges

Doesn't appear so, can we prove it?


First: What do we mean by "draw"?(need rigorous definition, for " proofs)

Chalkboard is by mathematically modelled by $$\mathbf{R}$$, the plane. 

Drawing without lifting chalk is modelled by "continuous maps"
