## Basic structures: Sets, Functions, Sequences, Sums and Matrices.

**Theorem 1**

for every set $$S\ (i)\ \emptyset \subseteq S$$ and $$(ii)\ S\ \subseteq S.$$

In another word, every set has at least 2 elements, the empty set and the set itself.







**Showing Two Sets are Equal**
To show that two sets A and B are equal, show that $$A \subseteq B$$ and $$B \subseteq A$$

**DEFINITION 4**
Let S be a set. If there are exactly n distinct elements in S where n is a nonnegative integer, we say that S is a finite set and that n is the cardinality of S. The cardinality of S is denoted by $$|S|$$.

**DEFINITION 5**
A set is said to be infinite if it is not finite.

**DEFINITION 6**
Given a set S, the power set of S is the set of all subsets of the set S. The power set of S is denoted by $$\mathcal{P} (S)$$.

**DEFINITION 7**
The ordered n-tuple $$(a1, a2, . . . , a_{n})$$ is the ordered collection that has a_{1} as its first element, a_{2} as its second element, . . . , and $$a_{n}$$ as its n-th element.

**DEFINITION 8**

Let A and B be sets. The Cartesian product of A and B, denoted by $$A × B$$, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b), where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Hence,

$$ A × B = \{(a, b) | a \ ∈ A \cup b ∈ B\}. $$

**DEFINITION 9**
The Cartesian product of the sets $$A_{1},A_{2},...,A_{n}$$, denoted by $$A_(1) × A_{2} ×···× A_{n}$$, is the set of ordered n-tuples (a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}), where a_{i} belongs to A_{i} for i = 1,2,...,n. In other words,
$$A_(1) × A_{2} ×···× A_{n} = {(a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}) | a_{i} \in A_{i} \ for \ i = 1,2,..., n }$$

A subset R of the Cartesian product A × B is called a **relation** from the set A to the set B. The elements of $$\mathbf{R}$$ are ordered pairs, where the first element belongs to A and the second to B. For example, R = {(a, 0), (a, 1), (a, 3), (b, 1), (b, 2), (c, 0), (c, 3)} is a relation from the set {a, b, c} to the set {0, 1, 2, 3}. A relation from a set A to itself is called a relation on A


∀x ∈S (P(x))is shorthand for ∀x(x ∈ S → P(x))

truth set of P to be the set of elements x in D for which P(x) is true. The truth set of P(x) is denoted by $$\{x ∈ D \vert P(x)\}$$.
