proof by induction on numbers of ears. 







Induction step:
Have $$E_{l}$$ = last ear in decomposition. 
$$\alpha$$ = assor are.
then $$\alpha \lvert_{0,1}:(0,1)\to \mathbb_{R^{2}}$$
is also a continuous injection so by re![ask what word]() to intervals of the form $$[\epsilon, 1-\epsilon]$$($$\epsilon$$ an arbitrary small #)

and a continuous injection [$$\epsilon,1-\epsilon] \to \mathbb{R^{2}$$]
is an arc (after rescaling $$[\epsilon,1-\epsilon]$$)

so we see that $$\alpha \setminus$$ endpoints
lies entirely inside some face F of G'. 

By induction, F is bounded by a cycle C in G?

Let $$v_{0}$$ and $$v_{1}$$ be the end points of $$E_{l}$$ so l gives paths p,p' from $$v_{0}$$ to $$v_{1}$$

Now P and $$E_{l}$$ give cycle P' and $$E_{l}$$ "" D'. The split F into 2 regions boundary by D,D'. 

all other faces of G' are preserved when adding $$E_{l}$$ (so all faces of G are bounded by cycles, as desired) Q.E.D

An important class of examples
If you have a polyhedron in $$\mathbb{R^{2}}$$
(like cube, pyramid,"cone over n-gon" pentagonal prism, tetrahedron, octahedron, ...)

then the vertices + edges of P from a graph.

(the 1-skeleton of P)

Fact: Graph G is the 1-skeleton of some polyhedron P $$iff$$ G is plannar and 3 - connected.

(the faces of P are the faces of a drawing of G)

REcall: (Euler's formula for trees)
For tree, $$\lvert V \lvert - \lvert E \lvert = 1$$
Planar graph: are " tree-like" in the following sense. 



Theorem (Euler's formula for plannar graphs)

Let G = (V,E) be a connected non-empty graph with an $$\mathbb_{R^2}$$ drawing have f faces. 

Then $$\lvert V \lvert - \lvert E \lvert + f= 2$$

Corallary $$\lvert V \lvert - \lvert E \lvert + f= 2$$ for any polyhedron

Ex: Octahedron
6 - 12 + 8 = 2

cube
8 - 12 + 6 = 2

Tree: $$\lvert V \lvert - \lvert E \lvert + f= 2$$

Lemma: If G is a tree with $$\mathbb_{R^{2}}$$- drawing then drawing has a single face.

PF omitted
Pf of Euler's formula: 
Induction on $$\lvert E \lvert$$:
Basecase: $$\lvert E \lvert = 0$$

so $$\lvert V \lvert=1$$, f = 1 by nonempty
And 1-0+1=2
