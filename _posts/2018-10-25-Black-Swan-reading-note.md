### Platonic Folds and Platonicity.

NNT focuses a lot of attention on our tendency to view our concepts, models and representations as pure, sharp, crisp, abstract forms. A Platonic fold is “the place where our Platonic representation enters into contact with reality and you can see the side effects of models.” (p. 309) I think, more accurately, since we never really have such contact, it’s the place where our representations are confronted with statements or thoughts about reality which diverge from expectations we’ve developed by using the models. Platonicity, refers to our tendency to focus on our Platonic representations, “at the cost of ignoring those objects of seemingly messier and less tractable structures.” (p. 309) That is, it is our tendency to not see Platonic folds with sufficient clarity to know where it is that our models are failing us; or, in other words, to “mistake the map for the territory.”
