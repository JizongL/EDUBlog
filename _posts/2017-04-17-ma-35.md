Theorem: $$K_{5}$$ is not plannar






Assume for contradiction that I have $$\mathbb{R}^{2}$$-drawing, If $$v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{5}$$ the vertices in $$K_{5}$$ (identified with points in $$\mathbb{R}^{2}$$)

Now $$v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{5}$$ forms 3-cycle in G so induces Jordan curve in $$\mathbb{R}^{2}$$

Then WLOG $$v_{4}$$ is in interior region, bounded by this Jordan Curve.We must also have $$v_{5}$$ in the interior region as otherwise $$\alpha_{4,5}$$ crosses the Jordan Curve formed by $$v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}$$

But now $$v_{4}$$ has arcs to $$v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}$$ so the 3 3 cycles 

$$v_{1},v_{2},v_{4}$$ 

$$v_{1},v_{3},v_{4} $$

$$v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}$$

dividing insie of $$v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}$$ into 3 regions. 

$$v_{5}$$ must be in one of these, WLOG inside $$v_{1},v_{2},v_{4}$$ (otherwise relabel $$\setminus$$ rotate) but then $$\alpha_{3,5}$$ cross a Jordan Curve. # Q.E.D

A subdivision of a graph is obtained by replacing an edge e.

### Theorem (Kuratowski)

A graph G is planar $$\iff$$ no subgraph of G is $$\leadsto$$ to a subdivision of $$K_{5}$$ or $$K_{3,3}$$

PF of ($$\impliedby$$) is hard, beyound the scope of this class. 

PF of ($$\implies$$) is easy

Lemma 1: If G is plannar, then any subgraph of G is plannar. 

PF: restrict the $$\mathbb{R^{2}}$$-drawing of G to the subgraph. Q.E.D



Lemma 2: Graph G is plannar $$\iff$$ G%e is plannar (for e an edge of G)

sketch: 

Suppose for contradiction that plannar G has S.G H is. to subdivide of $$k_{5}$$ or $$k_{3,3}$$ By L1 H is planar, and by repeated application of L2, we get that $$k_{5}$$ or $$k_{3,3}$$ is planar. # Q.E.D


Relationship with 2-connectivity

Each Jordan Curve in $$\mathbb{R^{2}}$$ into regions (the faces of G)

Every cycle gives a Jordan Curve. 

But: Not every edge need be part of a Jordan Curve. 

Not every face need be interior/exterior of cycle

If G is 2 connected, then life is easier. 

Theorem: If G is 2 connected, graph with $$\mathbb{R}^{2}$$ drawing that every face of the drawing is the interior or exterior region of some cycle in G. 


![pic4]()

every face is bounded by a cycle. orange cycle bounds no (single) face. 


Proof: Recall G is 2-connected $$iff$$ G has ear decomposition
