Bridges of Konigsberg

![bridge of Kon](http://world.mathigon.org/resources/Graph_Theory/bridges.png)

Q: In which bridge configurations can we stroll over each bridge exactly once?






Definition: A (closed) Eulerian tour for graph G = (V,E) is a walk $$\{v_{0},v_{1},v_{2},...v_{n-1},v_{0}\}$$ note: same as start. 

Where each edge is used exactly once(ie, for each $$e \in E)$$ there is a unique i
such that $$e =\{v_{i},v_{i+1}\} "mod \ m"$$

If G has a closed Eulerian tour, then G is Eulerian. 

Intuitively: Eulerian graph is one you can draw without lifting your chalk, and returning to where you start. 

Exi: 

![eularian graph](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/images/graph-path.gif)

Lemma: If G has a vertex of odd degree, then G is not Eulerian. 

Proof: An Eulerian tour visits vertex v some number of times $$t_{v}$$. And then $$deg_{G}v=2 \cdot t$$ (since tour enters on each visit)

### Harder Theorem (Euler)

The graph G = (V,E) is Eulerian $$\iff$$ G is connected upto vertices of $$deg_{0}$$ and $$deg_{G}v$$ is even for every $$v \in V$$

("The obvious necessary condition is also sufficient")

Proof $$\implies$$ Lemma, definition of connected. 


$$\leftarrow$$ Define a tour is a walk where no edge is used twice.(or more)

(But may use vertices twice, not required to use every edge,)

So an Eulerian tour is a tour which starts and ends at some vertex, and uses every edge. 

Let $$T_{max}$$ be a tour of maximum possible length. We'll show $$T_{max}$$ is closed Eulerian.

1st step: 

Show $$T_{max}$$ starts and ends at same vertex. since if $$T = v_{0},v_{1},...,v_{m}$$ is tour with $$v_{0}≠ v_{m}$$ then T uses an odd number of edges incident to $$v_{m}$$ and the $$deg_{G} v_{m}$$ is even, there is unused edge incident to $$v_{m}$$

$$\implies$$ can extend T by this edge to longer tour.$$\implies$$ $$T ≠ T_{max}$$


2nd step

$$T_{max}$$ visits every vertex with degree > 0, suppose not: 

Then $$T_{max}= v_{0},v_{1},...,v_{m-1},v_{0}$$ (by 1st step above)

Since G is connected upto vertices of degree 0, if $$T_{max}$$ doesn't visit a vertex Z, then there is a walk from $$v_{0}$$ to Z, Look at 1st edge of walk leaving $$V(T_{max})$$ $$\{v_{k},w\}$$ for some k, $$w \in V$$ \ V(T)

But then $$v_{k+1},v_{k+2},...,v_{m-1},v_{0},v_{1},...,v_{k},w $$ is a longer tour, contradicting maximality of $$T_{max}$$ 


3rd step:

$$T_{max}$$ uses every edge. Suppose not, then $$\{v_{k},v_{l}\}$$ is unused edge. 

But then $$v_{k+1},v_{k+2},...,v_{m-1},v_{0},...,v_{k},v_{l}$$ is a longer tour, contradicting maximality. 

So $$T_{max}$$ uses every edge, so is Eulerian.
