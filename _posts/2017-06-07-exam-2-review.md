### Question 4
Prove there exists irrational numbers x and y such that $$x^y$$ is rational.

Know $$\sqrt{2}$$ is irrational,$$2^{\sqrt{2} \sqrt{2}} = (\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}})^{\sqrt{2}}$$ if $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$$ is rational, it is done. 
If $$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$$ irrational, then (\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}})^{\sqrt{2}}=2$$ proved. 

### Question 4.10
