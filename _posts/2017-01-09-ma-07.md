Last time review

pascal's triangle
Binomial theorem 
$$(1+x)^{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^{k}$$

Application 

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = 2^{n} = (1+1)^n$$

$$\sum_{k=0}{n}(-1)^{k}=0 (= (1-1)^{n})$$

$$\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}^{2} = \binom{2n}{k}$$


### Homework problem 1 explaination

#### Approach 1

Any $$x \in \{1,2,3,...n\}$$

is either in A (hence in B)

or in B but not A,

or in neither 

3 possibilities, making n independent choices. 

$$3^n$$

#### Approach 2

number of subsets of k-elements set is $$2^{k}$$

number of of $$\{1,2,....n\} $$

with k elements is $$\binom{n}{k}$$

So, choose a k element subsets B (for some k)

and then choose any subset $$A \in B$$, 

and number of ways to do this is $$\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} \cdot 2^{k} = (1+2)^{n}=3^{n}$$

### Ex1: 

How many strings can you get by rearranging letters of MISSISSIPPI, 

Warmup: Same questions with shorter words

* APP

APP PAP PPA

$$3 = \binom{3}{1}=\binom{3}{2}$$

* PAPA

$$6 = \binom{4}{2}$$

**MISSISSIPPI** 

#### Approach 1

choose 1 position for M
choose 4 position for I
choose 4 position for S
choose 2 position for P

$$\binom{11}{1} \cdot \binom{10}{4} \cdot \binom{6}{4} \cdot \binom{2}{2}$$

(since choices are independent up to what I mean by remaining)

### multinomial method

$$ \frac{11!}{1! 10!} \cdot \frac{10!}{4!6!} \cdot \frac{6!}{4!2!} \cdot \frac{2!}{2!0!}$$

$$=\frac{11!}{1!4!4!2!}$$

#### Approach 2

start by pretending the letters are different, then stop pretending. 

i.e.
add subscript

$$ M_{1}, I_{1}, S_{1}, S_{2},I_{2},S_{3},S_{4},I_{3},P_{1},P_{2},I_{4}$$

11!

drop subscript

any given word can be obtained from a subscripted word in 

$$1! \cdot 4! \cdot 4! \cdot 2!$$

number of ways to rearrange 

$$=\frac{11!}{1!4!4!2!}$$


There are many similar problems

### Ex-2

number of 13 card hands (from 52 card deck)

$$\binom{52}{13}$$

number of 13 card hands, with exactly 3 As.

$$\binom{4}{3} \binom{48}{10}$$

## 3.7 Inclusion and Exclusion principle 

At certain college, 

20 people in a football team

25 people in a baseball team

How many people are to play 1 of the 2 sports?

(need more information)

If z play both, then 

43 = 20+25 - 2
