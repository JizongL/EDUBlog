difference
pretty similar except for one thing.
sessionStorage(only last within browser session, disappear if browser is reopened)

localStorage(it still is there even browser is reopened.)


`window.btoa("j.lopez" + ":" + "password") === 'ai5sb3BlejpwYXNzd29yZA=='`


window method 
`window.localStorage.setItem`
