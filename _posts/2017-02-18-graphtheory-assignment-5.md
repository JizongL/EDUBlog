2. Which of the following statements about graphs G and H are true?
Substantiate your answers!

(i) G and H are isomorphic if and only if for every map f: V(G) → V(H) and for any two vertices u,v ∈ V(G), we have {u,v} ∈ E(G) ⇔ {f(u, f(v)} ∈ V (H).


(ii) G and H are isomorphic if and only if there exists a bijection f : E(G) → E(H).

(iii) If there exists a bijection f : V (G) → V (H) such that every vertex u ∈ V(G) has the same degree as f(u), then G and H are isomorphic.

(iv) If G and H are isomorphic, then there exists a bijection f : V (G) → V (H) such that every vertex u ∈ V (G) has the same degree as f (u).

(v) If G and H are isomorphic, then there exists a bijection f : E(G) → E(H).

(vi) G and H are isomorphic if and only if there exists a map f : - V(G) → V(H) such that for any two vertices u,v ∈ V(G), we have {u,v} ∈ E(G) ⇔ {f(u),f(v)} ∈ E(H).

(vii) Every graph on n vertices is isomorphic to some graph on the vertex set {1,2,...,n}.

(viii) Every graph on n ≥ 1 vertices is isomorphic to infinitely many graphs.



An automorphism of a graph G = (V,E) is any isomorphism of G and G, i.e. any bijection f: V → V such that {u,v} ∈ E if and only if {f(u),f(v)} ∈ E. A graph is called asymmetric if its only automorphism is the identity mapping (each vertex is mapped to itself).

(a) Find an example of an asymmetric graph with at least 2 vertices. 



(b) Show that no asymmetric graph G exists with 1 < |V (G)| ≤ 5.
