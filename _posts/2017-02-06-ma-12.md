## 2 Questions to ask






1) How many graphs are there on v = $$\{1,2,...,n\}$$?

Q1 is easy, $$2^{\binom{n}{2}}$$ = # subsets of $$\binom{V}{2}$$

e.g: 

n = 3 $$\implies$$ 8 graphs

n = 4 $$\implies$$ 64 graphs.

2) How many graphs are there on v = $$\{1,2,...,n\}$$, up to isomorphism?

Q2 is very hard. 

small cases: 

n = 2: 
n = 3:

note (pictures 1,2)

so 4 graphs up to isomorphism,(4 isomorphism classes of graphs when n = 3)

See textbook for details. 

## 4.2 Graph Terminology

### some examples 

Mathematical structures can admit substructure. 
E.g: 
* Sets have subsets. 
(for example, the inclusion and exclusion principle examples)

* Vector spaces have subspaces. etc. 

### subgraph

Graphs have 2 interesting kinds of substructures. 

Definition: 

Let $$G = (V,E) \ and \ G_{s}=(V_{s},E_{s})$$ be graphs

we say that $$G_{s}$$ is a subgraph of G if $$V_{s} \subseteq V \ and \ E_{s} \subseteq E$$ . 

(any subset of V, any subset of E, so both endpoints of edges are in $$V_{s}$$)

### Induced subgraph

We say G_{s} is an induced subgraph if $$ V_{s} \subseteq V \ and \ E_{s} = E \cap \binom{V_{s}}{2}$$
(any subset of V, all edges where both endpoints are in $$V_{s}$$)

Example: 

Complete graph $$k_{n}$$. 

Any graph on $$V=\{1,2,...,n\}$$ is a subgraph of $$K_{n}$$

$$K_{5}$$ minus 1 vertex gives induced subgraph, isomorphic to $$K_{4}$$

More generally, all induced subgraphs of $$K_{n}$$ will be smaller complete graphs. 

### Empty graph

It has n vertices, but $$E = \emptyset$$

All subgraphs, induced subgraphs are also empty graphs. 

Ex: $$C_{5}$$

![pic3]()

has $$P_{3}, P_{2},P_{1} \cup P_{0} $$ as induced subgraphs. 

and 

also $$P_{4}$$ as a subgraph (not induced)




Definition:

a path of length t in a graph  is a subgraph that is isomorphic to P_{t}. Thus, a path is a sequence $$\{v_{0},v{1}\},\{ v_{1},v{2}\},...\{v_{t-1},v_{t}\}$$ that are in E.
