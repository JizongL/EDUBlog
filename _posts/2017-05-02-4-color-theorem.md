This [4 color theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF-cEwZ5iZE) video explain pretty well on the concept. 
It uses the Jordan Curve principle to isolate the additonal vertex from the outer face to the vertex in the inner face. This remains true no matter how many more points are added.

This [The four color theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgbK43jB4rQ) video by Numberphile does a good job to help visualize the proof.
