Definition: If G is connected graph, the distance between vertices $$v,w$$ is $$d_{G}(v,w)\triangleq$$ (length of shortest path from v to w)







### Ex 1:

Petersen graph


Definition: The diameter of G is the longest distance between any 2 vertices in G.

### Ex 2:

diameter(Petersen) = 

since : rotation is automorphism, so I can take v to be fixed vertex of "outside" or "inside". 

If v on outside

Check 4 vertices on the outside ≤ 2

Check 5 vertices on the inside ≤ 2

If v on inside check 4 vertices on inside ≤ 2 (already did one inside, one outside)

A connection with linear algebra

Definition:
The adjacency matrix: $$A_{G}$$
of a graph G with $$V = \{v_{1},v_{2},...v_{n}\}$$

is the n x n matrix with entries
$$
a_{i,j} =
\begin{cases}
1,  & \text{if $\{v_{i},v_{j}\} \in \exists$ is even} \\[2ex]
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

### Ex 3:



Remark 1:
$$A_{G}$$ is symmetric across the diagonal 
$$(ie, a_{i,j}= a_{j,i})$$
and 0 on the diagonal
$$(ie, a_{i,i}= 0)$$

Remark 2:
$$A_{G}$$ is easy to store and work with a computer with good matrix libraries. 


Recall: In linear algebra you multiply matrices. 

(composition of linear transformations)

and 

($$A \cdot B$$)

has $$C_{i,j}=\sum_{l =1}^{n}a_{i,l} \cdot b_{l,j}$$


Prop: Let G= (V,E) be graph with ordered vertex set $$V = \{v_{1},v_{1},...,v_{n}\}$$

and adjacent matrix $$A =(A_{G})$$

Let $$A^{k}=A \cdot A\cdot A \cdots A$$

have $$i,j-th$$ entry $$a_{i,j}$$

then $$ a^{k}_{ij} = $$ # walks, of length of exactly k. from $$v_{i} \ to \ v_{j}$$
