review from last time. 

Ordering $$c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{m}$$ so that weights are weakly increasing, running Algorithm 1 returns a minimal weight spanning tree.





(Essential ingredient: Matroid Lemma)
Planner graphs: What graphs can you draw with out crossing edges?(in $$\mathbf{R}$$)

$$K_{5}$$

$$K_{2,3}$$

$$K_{3,3}$$


**"Recall":** 

A map $$f:[0,1]\to \mathbf{R}$$
is continuous if $$lim_{x \to x_{0}} f(x) = f(x_{0})$$ for each $$x_{0}\in [0,1]$$

ie, if $$\forall x_{0} \in [0,1],\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0$$ such that $$\forall x \in [0,1]$$ with $$\lvert x-x_{0} \lvert < \delta$$ we have $$\lvert f(x)-f(x_{0}) \lvert <  \epsilon $$ 


That is "close in x-values" $$\implies$$ "close in f(x) values" See Advance Calculus. 

Definition(basically, Calculus 3)

an arc in $$\mathbf{R^{2}}$$ is a Cls, injective map $$[0,1] \to \mathbf{R^{2}}$$,
Continuous means it doesn't cross itself (self-avoiding)

Definition: An $$\mathbf{R^{2}}$$ drawing (or $$\mathbf{R^{2}}$$-embedding) of graph G= (V,E) is an assignment 

$$b:V \to \mathbf{R^{2}}$$

$$\alpha: E \to \{\text{arcs in} \mathbf{R^{2}} \}$$

$$\{x,y\} \to \alpha_{x,y}$$

(i) b is injective 

(ii) $$\alpha_{x,y}(0) = b(x) $$ and $$\alpha_{x,y}(1) = b(y)$$

or vice versa

for each edge $$\{x,y\}$$("$$\alpha$$ respects edge endpoints")

(iii) $$\alpha_{x,y}(t_{1}) â‰  \alpha_{u,v}(t_{2})$$
for distinct edges $$\{x,y\}$$ and $$\{u,v\}$$ unless $$t_{1}$$ and $$t_{2}$$
are both in $$\{0,1\}$$

("arcs don't cross, but could meet at endpoints")

Exi: $$K_{4}$$


$$\alpha (t) = t(0,1)+(1-t)(0,0)$$

### Approach 2:

A "metric space" is a set with a distance for which satisifies sensible axioms. 

[0,1] is a "metric space" with distance $$d(x,y) = \lvert x - y\lvert$$

$$\leadsto$$ G is also a "metric space" (some details next time)
