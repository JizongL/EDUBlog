### Jump to the top and bottom of a file
ump to the bottom of the file

The are two steps involved in doing this. The first is to press `Ctrl + _` (underscore). This will ask for a line number at which point then press `Ctrl + V`. This will move the cursor directly to the bottom of the file.

Jump to the top of the file

This process is similar to the above but instead of pressing `Ctrl + V`, press `Ctrl + Y`. Voila, youâ€™re back at the top in just four keystrokes.


### Select multiple lines and cut
use CTRL+Shift+6 to mark the beginning of your block
move cursor with arrow keys to end of your block, the text will be highlighted.
use CTRL+K to cut/delete block.
