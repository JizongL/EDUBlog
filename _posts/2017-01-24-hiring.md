## About

My name is [Jizong Liang](http://www.tmmlab.com/about/) and I am an unclassified grad student, and currently taking graph theory and I major in computer science. I have taken calculus 1,2,3,4 and linear algebra at MSU and I love math. 

## goal
I specifically want to hire someone or someones who are strong in any of the following fields, so that I can converse and practice some higher level math problems with you. It's kind of like a math meetup, so you are paid to do what you love to do.  


* set theory 
* proof writing (important)
* combinatorics and counting
* linear algebra with proof
* probability 
* satatistics
* real analysis
(Note: if you have some programming skills, it would be nice too)

## schedule

In general, it is very flexible, I am available mostly in the afternoon during the week, and usually any time during the weekend. Once we are set up, we can work out the best schedule and meetup location on a weekly basis. 

## Compensation 

You will be paid according the hours for every section and the price is strictly depending how good you are and I will try to pay you well reasonably and it is negotiable after the first meetup. There is no minimum or maximum hours, it all depends on our schedule and the cotent we will study, but usually I would expect at least 2 hours a week. If you are interested and you are located in MSU or the surroundings, please leave me a message with your name, email and some basic bio. And I shall be in contact with you!
