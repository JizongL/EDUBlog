##exam 1
**Theorem 1**

uniqueness of the Reduced Echelon Form
Each matrix is row equivalent to one and only one reduced echelon matrix. 

**Theorem 2**
A linear system is consistent if and only if the rightmost column of the augmented matrix is not a pivot column -that is , if and only if an echelon form of the augmented matrix has no row of the form
				[0 ... 0   b]		with b nonzero
If a linear system is consistent, then the solution set contains either 
1: a unique solution, when there are no free variables, or 
2: infinitely many solutions, when there is at least one free variable. 


**Definition**
If $$\{v_{1},...,v_{p}\}$$ are in $$\mathbb{R}$$, then the set of all linear combinations of $$\{v_{1},...,v_{p}$$. And is called the subset of $$\mathbb{R}^{n}$$ spanned (or generated) by $$\{v_{1},...,v_{p}\}$$. That is, Span $$\{v_{1},...,v_{p}\}$$ is the collection of all vectors that can be written in the form 
 $$\{c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}+...+c_{p}v_{p}\} $$
 with $$c_{1},...,c_{p}$$ scalars.
