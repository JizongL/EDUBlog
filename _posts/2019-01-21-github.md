cd: change directory, used to move from one directory (a.k.a., folder) to another
pwd: print working directory, used to print the name of the folder you're currently in
ls: list, used to list the contents of a directory
mkdir: make directory, used to create a new directory
touch: used to create a new (empty) file with a given name
rm: remove, used to remove a file (or folder)
rmdir: remove directory, used to remove a directory
mv: move, used to move a file or directory
cp: copy, used to copy a file or directory



`mkdir` `touch`
`cat test/foo.txt`

create nesting folders
`mkdir -p test/cats/dogs/bears`


`cd desktop/Cute animal pictures `will return an error, but `cd desktop/Cute\ animal\ picture`s will take you where you want to go. The easiest route though is to avoid spaces altogether.


`cd ../..` would take you to the grandparent directory of the one you're currently in.

`touch .hidden-file.txt` to create a new hidden file inside the test folder

To view hidden files and folders, we need to use the `-a` flag

For window user
To hide a file on Windows, you must set the file's attribute to hidden as well. This can be done in Git Bash using the attrib command. Type attrib +h plus the file path in quotations. For example:

`$ attrib +h "C:\Users\benvi\test\.hidden-file.txt"`

 `rm` (remove) and `rmdir` (remove directory)

 deleting in the command line environment is permanent!!.

dangerous
 `rm -rf /`

`rm -i` warning before permanent delete.

`rmdir` can only be used to delete empty directories

if a directory has files or directories inside, use rm `-r` recursive and `-f` automatically remove without comfirmation

Then try `rm -rf cats`. This time the (permanent!)

moving files and filders `mv`
