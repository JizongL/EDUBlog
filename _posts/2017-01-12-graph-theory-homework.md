## section 1.3 Mathematical induction and other proofs

2. The numbers F0,F1,F2,... are defined as follows (this is a definition
by mathematical induction, by the way): F0 = 0, F1 = 1, Fn+2 =
F +F forn=0,1,2,...Provethatforanyn≥0wehaveF ≤ n+1 √ n n
((1 + 5)/2)n−1 (see also Section 12.3).

3. (a) Let us draw n lines in the plane in such a way that no two are parallel and no three intersect in a common point. Prove that the plane is divided into exactly n(n + 1)/2 + 1 parts by the lines.

(b) Similarly, consider n planes in the 3-dimensional space in gen- eral position (no two are parallel, any three have exactly one point in common, and no four have a common point). What is the number of regions into which these planes partition the space?
