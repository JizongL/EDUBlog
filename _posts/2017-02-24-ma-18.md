Review from Last time

* Prep For any G=(V,E), have $$\sum_{v \in V deg_{G}v = Z \cdot \lvert E \lvert}$$

* the number of vertices with odd degree is even in a finite graph. 

* A sperner coloring of subdivision of a big Triangle gives different colors to corners of the big triangle



Sperner's Lemma Theorem 

Any sperner coloring of any subdivision of triangle has a rainbow small triangle.

**Proof:** 

Assume the colors are R,G,B. 

Define a graph G

V = $$\{$$ all small triangles $$v_{1},v_{2}...,v_{n}$$ and outside of big triangle$$\}$$
E = $$\{$$ pairs that share RB side $$\}$$


Tree 


First: find degree $$v_{i}$$ for each small triangle $$v_{1},v_{2}...,v_{n}$$

case1: deg $$v_{i} = 0$$
if $$v_{i}$$ has no R corner or no B corner. 

case2: deg $$v_{i} > 0$$
then $$v_{i}$$ has RB side, so has a R corner and a B corner. 

if 3rd corner is G
then $$deg_{v_{i}} = 1$$ and $$v_{i}$$ is rainbow

if 3rd corner is R or B
then $$deg_{v_{i}} = 2$$

Thus: never has degree 3 (or higher)
and $$deg_{v_{i}} = 1 \iff v_{i}$$ is rainbow 

Now: deg $$W_{outer} =$$ number of alternations between R and B along RB side of big triangle. 

Since one corner is R, other is B, it must have odd number of alternations, so deg $$W_{outer}$$ is odd. 

By handshaking Lemma, G has even number of odd degree vertices. 

odd number of odd degree small triangles. 

odd number of small triangles with degree 1. 

the number of rainbow  small triangle is odd and is particular non-zero. 


Fair division problem 

Idea: you and 2 roommates, want to split rent $ 3000 and split 3 rooms. 

points on triangle are ways to split rent.
