preprocessor director, with # in front.

```c++
#include <iostream>
```








`<iostream>` or `"iostream"`, they both compile, but have substle difference. 


`endl` or `"\n"` start newline.

To determine how many bytes each variable type uses, C++ provides the function sizeof(variableType).

`sizeof(type)`

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    using namespace std;
    cout << "int size = "<<sizeof(int)<<endl;
    cout << "short size = "<<sizeof(short)<<endl;
    cout << "long size = "<<sizeof(long)<<endl;
    cout << "char size = "<<sizeof(char)<<endl;
    cout << "float size = "<<sizeof(float)<<endl;
    cout << "double size = "<<sizeof(double)<<endl;
    cout << "bool size = "<<sizeof(bool)<<endl;
    return 0;
}

```
