### Exercise 7.2 
Are $$15,462,227$$ and $$15,462,229$$ relatively prime?

gcd(a,b)=gcd(a,bâˆ’a)

15,462,229-15,462,227=2

gcd(15,462,229,2) = 1, because 15,462,229 is odd.

### Exercise 7.3
If $$n \in \mathbb{N}$$, under what conditions are $$n$$ and $$n + 2$$ relatively prime?

Note that
$$(n+2)-n = 2$$
Hence, if $$d$$ is a common divisor of $$n$$ and $$n+2$$, then $$d$$ has to divide $$2$$. This means $$\gcd(n,n+2) = 1 \text{ or }2$$. Hence, if $$n$$ is

 - even, $$\gcd(n,n+2) = 2$$
 - odd, $$\gcd(n,n+2) = 1$$.

 Exercise 7.5. Find $$gcd(8243235, 453169)$$



 Exercise 7.7
 Let $$a$$ and $$b$$ be integers and $$m = gcd(a, b)$$. Prove that $$\frac{a}{m}$$ and $$\frac{b}{m}$$ are relatively prime integers.
