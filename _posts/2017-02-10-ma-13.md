## Petersen graph 






Has cycle of length: 5, 9, 6. and others

### Definition: 

A graph is connected if 

$$\forall $$ pairs of vertices v,w 
$$\exists$$ path v to w

## A similar idea to path:

### Definition: 

A walk from vertex v to vertex w. is a sequence of vertices

v = v_{0}, v_{1},v_{2},..., v_{t} = w

such that $$\{v_{i},v_{i+1}\} \in E$$ for $$i\in\{0,1,...,t-1\}$$

Note: A walk allows vertices to be repeated a path does not (otherwise their definitions are the same)

## 2 questions to ask

Q Longest walk in Petersen? 
Arbitrarily long!

### Lemma: 

If G is a graph and $$\exists$$ walk v to w. Then any walk v to w of shortest possible length is a path. 

**Proof:**

Suppose it is not true. (by contradition)

Then $$v = v_{0}, v_{1},v_{2},..., v_{t} = w$$ is a shortest length walk, but not a path. Thus, some vertex is repeated 
i.e, $$v_{i}=v_{j}$$ for some $$i < j$$

But then 

$$v_{0}, v_{1},v_{2},..., v_{j+1},v_{j+2},...,v_{t}$$

is another walk v to w with shorter length. Therefore, this is a contradition. # 

So supposition must be false. So, the lemma true,  If G is a graph and $$\exists$$ walk v to w. Then any walk v to w of shortest possible length is a path. (see picture below)

### Corollary: 

$$\exists$$ path v to w in G. $$\iff \exists \ walk \ """"""$$

proof: 

$$ \implies$$ by defintion. <br>
$$\Leftarrow$$ by Lemma above, if there is a walk, then shortest such is path

Define a relation on V(G)

by $$v \sim w$$ if $$\exists $$ walk (path)

by $$v \not \sim w$$ if $$ \not \exists $$ such a walk 

Check: This is equivalence relation 

$$i.e \ v \sim v$$ and $$ v \sim w \iff w \sim v$$

$$v \sim w, w \sim z \implies v \sim z$$

"concatenate walks"

so it gives a well-defined notion of "the same".

The connected components are the equivalence classes fo this relation.

ie. sets of vertices where you can walk between every pair.
