How does 2-connectivity relate to connectivity?






## Lemma 1: 

G 2-connected $$\implies$$ G connected.

proof: 

What need to be shown?

Need to show $$\forall v,w$$, there is path v to w in G. 

Given v,w, let x be some other vertex, (since $$\lvert V \lvert$$ ≥ 3, there is such an x)

Now G \ x is connected $$\implies \exists$$ path v to w in G \ x and a path v to w in G\w is also a path in G. 


Lemma 2: 

G 2-connected, then $$\forall e \in E$$, G\e is connected. 

proof: suppose G \ e is not 2-connected for some e = $$\{v,w\}$$ (for contradiction)

Then G \ w is connected $$\implies deg_{G} v > 1$$ 

(since otherwise deleting w would leave v as isolated vertex)

so v has neighbor u ≠ w, Let x,y be vertices in G, neither equal to v. Then $$\exists$$ path x to y in G \ v which is also a path in G \ e. Remains to show $$\exists$$ path in G \ e from x to v (where x any vertex) 

But there is path x to u in G \ v, hence in G \ e. add v to this path, (since $$\{v,u\} \in E$$)

## Next goal

prove structure theorems for 2 connected graphs. 

Theorem A: A graph G = (V,E) is 2-connected $$\iff \forall v,w,\in V, \exists$$ a cycle in G containing v,w.

proof: $$ \impliedby \forall v,w,x \in V$$ must show $$\exists$$ path v to w in G\x, But: the cycle containing v,w gives 2 vertex-disjoint paths v to w. 


so x is on at most one of these paths, thus, there is at least one path v to w that avoids x, (ic, path in G \ x)

$$\implies$$ proceed by induction on $$d = d_{G}(v,w)$$ = distance v to w in G

Base case: d = 1

Then $$e = \{v,w\}$$ is an edge

But by Lemma 2, there is path v to w in G \ e"Adding e" closes the path to a cycle.

Inductive step: "d-1 $$\implies d$$"

Given v,w with $$d_{G}(v,w)=d$$

so the shortest path v to w has form $$v = v_{0},v_{1},v_{2},...,v_{d-1},v_{d} = w$$

Then $$D_{G}(v,v_{d-1})=d-1$$

By inductive hypothesis, $$\exists$$ cycle containing $$v, v_{d-1}$$

Also, since $$G\v_{d-1}$$ is connected $$\exists$$ path P from w to v which avoids $$v_{d-1}$$

Let x be the vertex on both C and P that is closest to w on P. 

Now "splice" C by removing the segment between x and $$v_{d-1}$$ replacing the segment of P between x and w, plus the edge from w to $$v_{d-1}$$

Since the segment of P from w to x avoids C, except at x, we don't have repeated repeated vertices, so this is a cycle, as desired.  Q.E.D
