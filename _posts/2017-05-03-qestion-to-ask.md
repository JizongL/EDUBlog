For G = (V, E) a graph, let ∆(G) = max v∈V deg v. That is, ∆(G) is the highest degree of any vertex in G.
(a) (2 points) Give an example of a graph G such that χ(G) = ∆(G) + 1. (b) (8 points) 

Show that for any graph G we have χ(G) ≤ ∆(G) + 1.

3. Prove that a planar graph in which each vertex has degree at least 5 must have at least 12 vertices.



6. ∗Consider an arbitrary drawing (not necessarily planar) of the complete graph $$K_{n}$$. Prove that at least $$\frac{1}{5}\binom{n}{4}$$  pairs of edges have to cross. (Use the nonplanarity of $$K_{5}$$.)
