King David wrote that a "broken spirit" and a "contrite heart" are offerings that most please God (Psalm 51:17).

When faced with the consequences of our sin and the suffering of living in a fallen world, we can harden our hearts and become cynical or open them by crying out to God for help and comfort.

feel regret or sadness about (the loss or disappearance of something).

### How Long, O Lord, How Long?

“I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with
tears; I drench my couch with my weeping” (Ps. 6:6).

“You have kept count of my
toss­ings; put my tears in your bottle. Are they not in your book?” (Ps. 56:8).

Indeed they are! “Blessed are those who mourn” (Matt. 5:4).

It is a beautiful thing when a broken man genuinely cries out to God


I don’t mean that we make peace with darkness. We
fight for joy. But we fight as those who are saved by grace and held by Christ. We
say with [Paul Gerhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gerhardt)
that our night will soon—in God’s good timing—turn to day

Give to the winds thy fears,
Hope and be undismayed.
God hears thy sighs and counts thy tears,
God shall lift up thy head.

Through waves and clouds and storms,
He gently clears thy way;
Wait thou His time; so shall this night
Soon end in joyous day.

Far, far above thy thought,
His counsel shall appear,
When fully He the work hath wrought,
That caused thy needless fear.

Leave to His sovereign sway
To choose and to command;
So shalt thou, wondering, own that way,
How wise, how strong this hand.


### Overcoming Negative Internal Chatter
For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.

Romans 8:5
